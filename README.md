## Handling Updates from the Main Repository

Sometimes, the `main` branch of the original repository will be updated while you are working on your branch. Hereâ€™s how to keep your local branch up-to-date:

1. **Add the Original Repository as a Remote**
   - First, add the original repository as a remote. This is usually named `upstream`.
     ```sh
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/username/CSD1103-Project.git
     ```

2. **Fetch the Latest Changes**
   - Fetch the latest changes from the original repository:
     ```sh
     git fetch upstream
     ```

3. **Merge the Latest Changes**
   - Switch to your `main` branch:
     ```sh
     git checkout main
     ```
   - Merge the changes from `upstream/main` into your local `main` branch:
     ```sh
     git merge upstream/main
     ```

4. **Rebase Your Feature Branch**
   - Switch back to your feature branch:
     ```sh
     git checkout feature/AmazingFeature
     ```
   - Rebase your branch with the updated `main`:
     ```sh
     git rebase main
     ```

5. **Resolve Conflicts (if any)**
   - If there are any merge conflicts, resolve them manually. After resolving conflicts, continue the rebase process:
     ```sh
     git rebase --continue
     ```

6. **Push Your Updated Feature Branch**
   - After rebasing, you need to force push your feature branch to update it on GitHub:
     ```sh
     git push --force origin feature/AmazingFeature
     ```

## Additional Git Commands and Troubleshooting

### Common Commands

- **Check the Status**
  - To check the status of your working directory and staging area:
    ```sh
    git status
    ```

- **View Commit History**
  - To view the commit history:
    ```sh
    git log
    ```

- **Discard Changes**
  - To discard changes in your working directory:
    ```sh
    git checkout -- <file>
    ```

- **Delete a Branch**
  - To delete a local branch:
    ```sh
    git branch -d feature/AmazingFeature
    ```
  - To delete a remote branch:
    ```sh
    git push origin --delete feature/AmazingFeature
    ```

### Troubleshooting

- **Error: 'Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally.'**
  - This happens when the remote branch has new commits that you donâ€™t have. To resolve this, first, pull the latest changes:
    ```sh
    git pull origin main
    ```
    Then resolve any conflicts that arise and commit the changes.

- **Error: 'You have uncommitted changes.'**
  - You need to either commit your changes or stash them before switching branches. To stash changes:
    ```sh
    git stash
    ```
    After switching branches, you can apply the stash:
    ```sh
    git stash apply
    ```

- **Error: 'Merge conflicts'**
  - Conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically merge changes. Open the conflicted files and manually resolve the conflicts. After resolving, add the resolved files:
    ```sh
    git add <file>
    ```
    Then continue the merge or rebase process:
    ```sh
    git commit -m 'Resolved merge conflicts'
    ```
